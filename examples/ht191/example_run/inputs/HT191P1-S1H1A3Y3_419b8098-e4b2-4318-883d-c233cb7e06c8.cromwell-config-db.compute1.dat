# Important : Prior to running, be sure to create a /storage1/fs1/dinglab/Active/Projects/estorrs/pecgs-pipeline/examples/ht191/example_run/runs/HT191P1-S1H1A3Y3_419b8098-e4b2-4318-883d-c233cb7e06c8 directory and replace all instances
# of the string /storage1/fs1/dinglab/Active/Projects/estorrs/pecgs-pipeline/examples/ht191/example_run/runs/HT191P1-S1H1A3Y3_419b8098-e4b2-4318-883d-c233cb7e06c8 below with the appropriate value.  For instance,
#   /storage1/fs1/dinglab/Active/Projects/estorrs/pecgs-pipeline/examples/ht191/example_run/runs/HT191P1-S1H1A3Y3_419b8098-e4b2-4318-883d-c233cb7e06c8="/scratch1/fs1/dinglab/m.wyczalkowski/cromwell-data"
# Rename the resulting file to cromwell-config-db.compute1.dat

# location to write error output logs from individual tools:
